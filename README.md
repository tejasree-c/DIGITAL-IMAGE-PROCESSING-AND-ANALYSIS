# DIGITAL-IMAGE-PROCESSING-AND-ANALYSIS
This project implements a complete digital image processing system in Python using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It was developed as part of the Image Processing and Analysis (IPA) coursework to demonstrate understanding of acquisition, enhancement, denoising, segmentation, and feature evaluation techniques.
